TXT Reviews is a customer feedback tool for any business that has regular customer interactions. It is perfect for restaurants, retail, and other service industries. Reviews and feedback are solicited via text messages sent to a location specific phone number. The goal is to provide a minimally frictional way for the customer to give realtime feedback to the business.

The customer interaction flow is as follows:

    1. The customer is told about the review phone-line via posted message in the business, receipt listing, or verbally.
    2. The customer sends a 1-10 review to the phone number.
    3. The customer is then prompted to respond with any additional comments by a custom message from the business.
    4. Finally, they receive a message thanking them. This message can also include links to additional surveys or promotions.

Clients can review the feedback they have received through our web portal. We include a summary page with weekly and monthly analytics. There is also a detailed review page where individual reviews can be seen.

Custom responses are setup on the website as well. The client provides a message to be sent back to the customer on successful and unsuccessful messages from the customer.

DEMO:

To demo the project, sign in with the following credentials:

EMAIL: demouser@demo.com
PASSWORD: 12345

This account is loaded with a substantial amount of dummy data to show how the user can view feedback.

Unfortunately the texting functionality can't be demoed as we are using a trial account with the messaging service which requires phone numbers to be verified before they can be responded to.
